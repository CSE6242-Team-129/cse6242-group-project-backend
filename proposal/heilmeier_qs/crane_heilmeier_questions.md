**Heilmeier Questions**

1.  **What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using
    absolutely no jargon**. We are using traffic accident data sets in
    the Los Angeles area to predict accident hot spots. These hot spots
    will be used by civilians to create safe routes for driving and for
    first responders to identify areas needing active patrols.

2.  **How is it done today; what are the limits of current
    practice?** There have been many studies predicting traffic
    accidents using regression and classification methods. Many
    different data types have been used as well. While some of these
    models have generated good predictions, none, in our research, have
    applied routing using the model or have been used for first
    responders.

3.  **What\'s new in your approach? Why will it be successful?** Our
    approach is new as it can actively route users around accident hot
    spots. It will be successful because accident estimation models and
    routing algorithms have been studied but have not yet been combined.

4.  **Who cares?** "According to WHO, each year 1.35 million people die
    and 20 to 50 million people sustain non-fatal injuries from traffic
    accidents" \[W. H. Organization et al. Global status report on road
    safety 2018: Summary\]. "In the US alone, traffic accidents cost
    \$871 billion annually" \[The economic and societal impact of motor
    vehicle crashes, 2010 (revised)\]. These statistics alone show that
    traffic accidents are vastly important to the regular driver and
    government.

5.  **If you\'re successful, what difference and impact will it make,
    and how do you measure them (e.g., via user studies, experiments,
    ground truth data, etc.)?** This tool could be used by first
    responders to identify areas that need early patrol, which could
    prevent death or as serious of injuries. It also can be used by the
    general public to follow more safe routes when driving. These could
    be measured by studies following implementation to see if serious
    injuries are reduced, in the first responder case, or if the number
    of accidents that users decrease, for the public case.

6.  **What are the risks and payoffs?** A risk is that we do not
    encapsulate all necessary predictors and the model is a poor
    prediction. While many studies have generated models, for ours to be
    effective it needs to have a high prediction capability. The payoff
    is that injuries and accidents can be reduced.

7.  **How much will it cost?** Beginning, it will not cost anything.
    With many free data sets from governments, we will have enough data
    to make an initial model. If niche data is needed, then there could
    be a cost to acquire it. The goal is to not have any cost associated
    to the project besides the time to complete it.

8.  **How long will it take?** This will take the 2 months assigned to
    the CSE-6242 project.

9.  **What are the midterm and final \"exams\" to check for success? How
    will progress be measured?** The midterm exam is to have a working
    model that can generate hot spots for traffic accidents with decent
    accuracy. The final exam is to have an implemented routing algorithm
    that finds the safest and fastest route for the user. Progress will
    be measured in weekly team meetings and progress reports.
