<9 Heilmeier questions>
-What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
We are trying to build a traffic safety map that is based on a traffic safety prediction model.
-How is it done today; what are the limits of current practice?
In terms of traffic maps, current practice is based on the shortest path. In other words, consumer-facing traffic maps show users the shortest in terms of distance/driving time. Also, in case of a traffic accident, once an accident happens the traffic time is added to the traffic maps to detour users from the affected road segment to the unaffected ones. Here, what we are going to do differently is that we will show the traffic maps to the users based on traffic safety prediction.
-What's new in your approach? Why will it be successful?
New: Dependent variables are different (i.e. traditional traffic maps predict the time from origination to target, however, we will predict the possibility of traffic accident)
Successful: Because there havenâ€™t been fully consumerized traffic maps that alert users of possible traffic accidents
-Who cares?
Users who want to be careful with possible traffic accidents
The public sector such as police departments and fire departments - can optimize the duty schedule based on traffic accident prediction
-If you're successful, what difference and impact will it make, and how do you measure them (e.g., via user studies, experiments, ground truth data, etc.)?
We can measure the accuracy of the prediction
We can perform user experience research
-What are the risks and payoffs?
Risks: In case we are far off from the prediction, that might not be to helpful to the users
Payoffs: If we are successful at traffic safety prediction and visualization of that on the map, then it will help general users and government sectors such as police departments and fire departments
-How much will it cost? 0
-How long will it take? 4 months
-What are the midterm and final "exams" to check for success? How will progress be measured?
Midterm exams: Does our prediction model work well with validation data?
Final exams: Are we getting good user feedback?
