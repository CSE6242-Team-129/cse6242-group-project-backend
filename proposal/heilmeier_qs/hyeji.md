<9 Heilmeier questions>
<br> -What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
<br> We are trying to build a traffic safety map that is based on a traffic safety prediction model.
<br> -How is it done today; what are the limits of current practice?
<br> In terms of traffic maps, current practice is based on the shortest path. In other words, consumer-facing traffic maps show users the shortest in terms of distance/driving time. <br> Also, in case of a traffic accident, once an accident happens the traffic time is added to the traffic maps to detour users from the affected road segment to the unaffected ones. <br> Here, what we are going to do differently is that we will show the traffic maps to the users based on traffic safety prediction.
<br> -What's new in your approach? Why will it be successful?
<br> New: Dependent variables are different (i.e. traditional traffic maps predict the time from origination to target, however, we will predict the possibility of traffic accident)
<br> Successful: Because there havenâ€™t been fully consumerized traffic maps that alert users of possible traffic accidents
<br> -Who cares?
<br> Users who want to be careful with possible traffic accidents
<br> The public sector such as police departments and fire departments - can optimize the duty schedule based on traffic accident prediction
<br> -If you're successful, what difference and impact will it make, and how do you measure them (e.g., via user studies, experiments, ground truth data, etc.)?
<br> We can measure the accuracy of the prediction
<br> We can perform user experience research
<br> -What are the risks and payoffs?
<br> Risks: In case we are far off from the prediction, that might not be to helpful to the users
<br> Payoffs: If we are successful at traffic safety prediction and visualization of that on the map, then it will help general users and government sectors such as police departments <br> and fire departments
<br> -How much will it cost? 0
<br> -How long will it take? 4 months
<br> -What are the midterm and final "exams" to check for success? How will progress be measured?
<br> Midterm exams: Does our prediction model work well with validation data?
<br> Final exams: Are we getting good user feedback?
