<Literature Survey>
<br> 1. Accident prediction models for urban roads
<br> - Main idea: There have been interpretation difficulties of the explanatory variables (such as the number of lanes, etc.) due to strong correlations within multiple variables in <br> developing prediction models. In this paper, the author examines which variables should be included in building prediction models.
<br> - Why is it useful: We can get insights on which variables we should include in building the prediction model for each road link and junction. For road links, the most relevant 
<br> variable is AADT (Annual Average Daily Traffic) while we might additionally need to consider land use, number of minor junctions, parking, speed limit, etc. for a prediction model <br> for junctions
<br> - Potential shortcomings: This paper considers road conditions in Demark, hence we might need to examine the scope of applicability of this paper to US road conditions

  <br> 2. The influence of traffic, geometric and context variables on urban crash types
<br> - Main idea: There have been studies of traffic safety prediction models and such traditional models often focus on the total probability of traffic accidents. However, in this
<br> paper author breaks down the traffic accident data into several crash types and estimates the likelihood of occurrence of each crash type
<br> - Why is it useful: The multinomial logit approach will be useful to look into the applicability of each of the multiple variables to each crash type. Also, the paper argues that <br> depending on the crash type, we might need to consider different sets of variables
<br> - Potential shortcomings: This approach will possibly increase the amount of time required in building a model.

  <br> 3. Handbook of Theoretical and Quantitative Geography (p.175 - 227)
<br> - Main idea: This chapter of the book provides real case studies of various learning models for geospatial data. Since we will use geospatial data in terms of longitude and latitude <br> in our project, we will need to apply machine learning modeling skills that can be optimized with the geospatial data. Here, we can learn different techniques including spatial 
<br> predictions/mapping, nonlinear dimensionality, and visualization of geospatial interpretation.
<br> - Why is it useful: In terms of geospatial data, we might need to perform non-linear classification and non-linear dimensionality reduction. Here, we can apply spectral clustering <br> and Laplacian eigenmaps
<br> - Potential shortcomings: Based only on local information, the normalized cut functional is not a suitable measure for the quality of clustering
