## Forecasting accident frequency of an urban road network A comparison of four

### Main Idea

Four different artificial neural network (ANN) based methods were used to predict accident frequency. The extreme learning machine was the most successful in predicting accident frequency (of the methods compared). The RReliefF algorithm was used to determine which independent variables are the most important to the predicting accident frequency. It was found that the presence of medians and parked cars on the right side of the road were not very important in predicting accident frequency.

### Is This Paper Useful?

This paper lays out a methodology for comparing the different ANN-based accident prediction methods. It also gives a method to determine which independent variables are most important in prediction which may help in reducing dataset dimensionality without sacrificing much prediction accuracy.

### Limitations

This study was limited in that data from only one city was used and only ANN-based methods were considered.

## A Gis Approach to Evaluate Infrastructure Variables Influencing the Occurrence of Traffic Accidents in Urban Roads

### Main Idea

This paper used GIS-based approaches to "examine the relationship between urban road accidents and variables" to reveal "possible accident-prone spots."

### Is This Paper Useful?

A GIS-based approach could be informative in identifying current accident hot spots, but it will not be useful in *predicting* accident frequency.

### Limitations

Only one city was examined and there were no methods of predicting accident frequency.

## Defining Machine Learning Algorithms as Accident Prediction Models for Italian Two Lane Rural Suburban and Urban Roads

### Main Idea

This paper attempted to predict the number of fatality and injury accidents on two-lane rural, suburban, and urban roads along a 905km secondary road network from 2008 to 2016. Included in the dataset were geometric, functional, and environmental data.

### Is This Paper Useful?

This paper is useful because it gives a methodology for using machine learning techniques for predicting accident frequency along with some geometric features of the road itself (which was also used in the GIS-based approach). The paper also gives direction for future research which will be useful for us to bring new innovations to the field. Also given, was a comparison methodology for the different machine learning techniques.

### Limitations

The paper only examined a secondary road network which may not be present or significant in larger urban areas such as Los Angeles.
